# An-electric-circuit-with-six-servo-motors

In my recent task for the Smart Methods summer training program, I designed and programmed a Tinkercad circuit with 6 servo motors. I connected three servos to pins 8, 10, and 12 and programmed them to turn 90 degrees. The other three servos were connected to pins 9, 11, and 13 and programmed to turn 180 degrees. Using the Servo library in Arduino, I attached each servo to its pin and wrote the code to move them to the specified angles. The Tinkercad simulation confirmed the correct functionality, enhancing my circuit design and programming skills.
